A ugly scheme interpreter by C.
1. It use string to simulate base element of scheme: list, 
"(+ 1 2)". It shoulde use linked list.
2. It use a simple memory malloc means(callstack_malloc) for
reduce code about alloc and free memory(It is needless in 
Scheme). Its disadvantage is waste lots of memory.
